## Installation

### Dependencies

- [spatie/laravel-sitemap](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-sitemap)
- [artesaos/seotools](https://github.com/artesaos/seotools)

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require binomedev/seo-panel
```

Then run the install command:

```bash
php artisan seo:install
```

### Publish Assets
You can publish and run the migrations with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Binomedev\SeoPanel\SeoPanelServiceProvider" --tag="seo-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Binomedev\SeoPanel\SeoPanelServiceProvider" --tag="seo-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
     /*
     * When this is enabled, the meta tags will be generated and injected auto-magically.
     * Set this to false if you want to manually generate the tags.
     */
    'auto_inject_enabled' => env('SEO_AUTO_INJECT', true),

    /*s
     * The 'You shall not pass' for this package.
     *
     * Set the paths where you don't want to generate seo tags.
     */
    'inject_except' => [
        'telescope*',
        'horizon*',
        'nova*',
    ],
];
```

## Usage

### Model Setup
 
Add the **CanBeSeoAnalyzed** interface and the **HasSeo** trait to any model that you would like to be used for SEO analyzing.

```php
namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

use Binomedev\SeoPanel\CanBeSeoAnalyzed;
use Binomedev\SeoPanel\Traits\HasSeo;

class Post extends Model implements CanBeSeoAnalyzed
{
    use HasFactory, HasSeo; 
}
```

Aand... in theory, that should be all of it. 
Well, there is more to it if you really want to get your hands dirty.

## Middlewares & Black Magic :fire:

By default, you don't have to add any middlewares as long as the 'auto_inject_enabled' is set to **true**.
However, if magic scares you, you should set it to **false** and add any middlewares that fits you.

It can be set in the .env file, there is no need to publish the config file.

```dotenv
SEO_AUTO_INJECT=false
```

Add middlewares in order to set the meta tags automatically.

```php
[
    // App\Http\Kernel.php.
    'web' => [
        //...
        \Binomedev\SeoPanel\Http\Middleware\SetDefaultSeoTags::class,
        \Binomedev\SeoPanel\Http\Middleware\EntangleSeoEntity::class,
        \Binomedev\SeoPanel\Http\Middleware\InjectSeoTags::class,
        //...
    ]
];
```

Let's break it down, shall we? 

#### SetDefaultSeoTags Middleware

Starting with **SetDefaultSeoTags::class**, this middleware, sets the default meta tags from the *seo_options* table. 
Such as default title (Site Name, company name, etc), title separator and a description.

Any of these can be overridden within any controller method. Example:

```php

use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
// Make sure to import the SEOTools;
use Artesaos\SEOTools\Traits\SEOTools; 

class PageController extends Controller {
    use SEOTools;
    
    public function dashboard()
    { 
        // Use the following method chain to set a description.
        $this->seo()->setDescription('New description.');
        // Or
        \SeoTools::setDescription('Some description using the facade.');
    
        return view('dashboard');
    }
}
```

You can find out more about the [SEOTools here](https://github.com/artesaos/seotools).

#### EntangleSeoEntity Middleware

Some meta tags, including the description, are overridden by the *'EntangleSeoEntity::class'* middleware.
Which can be used for single and groups of routes or, as suggested above, using the web middleware.

If you want to do it the manual way, you can use the following syntax:

```php
// In some controller
use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use Artesaos\SEOTools\Traits\SEOTools;
use App\Models\Post;

class PageController extends Controller {
    use SEOTools; // <--- Remember to use the trait.
    
    public function show(Post $post)
    { 
        // ...
     
        $this->seo()->setTitle($post->seoMeta->title);
        $this->seo()->setDescription($post->seoMeta->description);
        $this->seo()->metatags()->setKeywords($post->seoMeta->keywords);
        
        // ... 
    }
}

```

#### InjectSeoTags Middleware

'InjectSeoTags::class' middleware is responsible for generating and actually injecting the html in the head section. 
However, 95% of this is just trying to figure it out if and where should inject the content. 
If you do not wish for this overhead, then you can simply remove the middleware and just paste following line:

```html
<!-- layouts/app.blade.php-->
<head>
    <!-- ... -->
    {{ SEOTools::generate($minify = true) }}
    <!-- ... -->
</head>
```

### Extending

todo

#### Inspectors

Inspectors are used to search for generic issues that may impact seo, such as: not using https, missing sitemap, speed
loading, etc

#### Scanners


Scanners are used to search for seo issues within a resource/model's fields, such as: title, slug, content, etc.


### Schedules

```php
// app/Console/Kernel.php
function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    //...
    $schedule->command('seo:generate-sitemap')->daily();
    // ...
}
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
